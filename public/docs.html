                                are used to draw something in 1:1 scale which can then be exported
                                to a sheet view via the <a href="">viewport tool</a> and then
                                exported with a frame/title block.

                                    a view defines which scale the view should be in when it is
                                    drawn with a viewport in a sheet view. And the crop region is

                                    cannot be moved (but you can move the objects into the crop

                                You can also drag the mouse (with the left mouse button down) to
                                select the objects that are fully within the area that appears (it
                                checks if all of the red edge points are within that area).<br />
                                If you press the <a href="">control key</a> while clicking on an
                                object or dragging the mouse, any object that were previously select
                                will remain selected, this allows you to select multiple objects by
                                clicking on each one while holding control.

                            <h1>Command box</h1>
                            <p>
                                The command box lets you specify precise distances when drawing and
                                moving objects. The command box can either take a single value
                                representing a distance or two values representing a distance in the
                                x-axis and y-axis
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                One cool feature that you can use with the command box is to leave
                                one section empty (a section is basically a measurement). You can
                                for example type ",100cm" or "100m," (note the ",") now you're still
                                using two sections because of the "," but one of the sections is
                                empty, when a section is empty it will default to the mouse
                                position, so you could for example draw a line where the x
                                coordinate is calculated based on the number you provided in the
                                command box and the y coordinate is calculated based on the mouse
                                position.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>Here are some examples of how to use the command box:</p>

                                    "100cm, 20mm" when drawing a rectangle - will create a rectangle
                                    with the width 100cm and the height 20mm

                                    (here we are assuming that the <a href="">default unit</a> is

                                <li>
                                    "100cm, 5m" when drawing an ellipse - will create an ellipse
                                    with the radiusX of 100cm and the radiusY of 5m
                                </li>

                                    "10dm, 100" when moving an object - will move the selected
                                    objects 10dm in the <a href="">x-axis</a> and 100mm in the

                                    <a href="">default unit</a> is mm)

                                    "10cm," when drawing a rectangle - will create a rectangle with

                                    is

                                    that the <a href="">x-axis</a> will go to the mouse position and
                                    the y-axis 5dm

                                of the mouse position, but you can also enter negative numbers that
                                will go the other way.
