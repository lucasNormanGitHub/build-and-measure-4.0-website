                                A project consists of multiple views and sheets. <br />
                                Views and sheets are similar in many ways, but one difference is
                                that the sheets allow you to export the a drawing within a title
                                block. A view is where you can draw in 1:1 scale, but to export to a
                                drawing with a title block you need to use a sheet

                                To select an object you need to activate the select tool in the

                                You can select an object by clicking on it or by clicking on a
                                <a href="">snap point</a> on that object.<br />
                                You can also drag the mouse (with the left mouse button down) to
                                select the objects inside of the area that appears.<br />
                                If you press the <a href="">control key</a> while clicking on an
                                object or dragging the mouse, any object that were previsly select
                                will remain selected. Select an object by pressing on it or by
                                pressing on a <a href="">snap point</a> on that object. To select
                                multiple object you can drag the mouse around the objects to select
                                them. An object needs to be fully within the reactangle for it to be
                                selected.
                                <br />
                                You can also select multiple objects by pressing control when
                                pressing on an object.

                                Here is a list of all of the drawing properties:

                                The context menu is similar to the drawing palette in that it has
                                the almost same drawing propeties, now called object properties with
                                the exception of one extra: "Text"<br />
                                The context menu is only active when one or more objects are
                                selected

                            <p>
                                The command box lets you specify precise distances when drawing and
                                moving objects.<br />
                                The command box can either take a single value representing a
                                distance or two values representing a distance in the x-axis and
                                y-axis<br />
                                One cool feature that you can use with the command box is to leave
                                one section empty (a section is basically a measurement). You can
                                for example type ",100cm" or "100m," (note the ",") now you're still
                                using two sections because of the "," but one of the sections is
                                empty, when a section is empty it will default to the mouse
                                position, so you could for example draw a line where the x
                                coordinate is calculated based on the number you provided in the
                                command box and the y coordinate is calculated based on the mouse
                                position.
