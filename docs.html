                                This will open the editor with an

                                The first time you press the save button in a new project you will
                                be required to specify a file location but after that the file
                                location will be remembered. <br /><br />
                                You can also save a project with the
                                <a href="">save as button</a> which will let you select a file and
                                write the project to that file, although the file location won't be
                                stored so the save button will still save in the same file.

                                In Build and Measure you can hold down the scrollwheel and move the

                                zoom in and out.<br />
                                You can also change the "zoom speed" in the

                                Views and sheets are similar in many ways, but one difference is
                                that the sheets allow you to export the a drawing within a title
                                block. A view is where you can draw in 1:1 scale, but to export to a
                                drawing with a title block you need to use a sheet

                                To draw an object, select which object to draw in the

                                Each object requires a different amount of clicks:

                                To change for example the line width and stroke color of the object
                                that will be drawn, you can change the drawing properties in the

                                select a tool you can see which drawing properties that are grayed
                                out and which ones that are available for that object.

                                The context menu is similar to the drawing palette in that it has
                                the almost same drawing propeties, now called "object properties"
                                with the exception of one extra: "Text".<br />
                                The context menu is only active when one or more objects are
                                selected and the values in the context menu are the same as on the
                                object.

                                    Two selected objects can have different values and then the
                                    object properties might look a little different, text/ number
                                    inputs now have the text "diff" and button are purple.

                            <h1>Command box</h1>
                            <p>
                                The command box lets you specify precise distances when drawing and
                                moving objects.<br />
                                The command box can either take a single value representing a
                                distance or two values representing a distance in the x-axis and
                                y-axis<br />
                                One cool feature that you can use with the command box is to leave
                                one section empty (a section is basically a measurement). You can
                                for example type ",100cm" or "100m," (note the ",") now you're still
                                using two sections because of the "," but one of the sections is
                                empty, when a section is empty it will default to the mouse
                                position, so you could for example draw a line where the x
                                coordinate is calculated based on the number you provided in the
                                command box and the y coordinate is calculated based on the mouse
                                position.
